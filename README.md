# Anatomy-Viewer

In this 3D anatomy visualiser it is possible to move, zoom, and rotate the model of the body. Through a GUI is possible to choose specific parts of the body so that, when selected, the model can spin to make them face the camera and pop-up windows with information on appear.

This project was developed with HTML-5, using Web-GL 2.0 (needs to be hosted on local server to run).
